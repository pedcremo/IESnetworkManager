-i18n project with English, Valenci√† and Spanish support
-Make an installer for the application. Now it's a very complicated proces that user should follow in order
to run the project
- Document classes with epydoc
- Refactor the code. Especially GenericRouter so it can "quack" like the Duck interface
- Add support for (iptables/linux) network devices
- Code classroom classes to support block by mac so if we don't have an ip range to block this is the last choice to grasp

- Write user documentation:
	-From the network's administrator perspective
	-From the developer ot student learning how to code following design patterns and good practices.
	-From the final user perspective that doesn't want to be aware of any technical knowledge

- Create, for the setup, a set of SQL statements with example data to be loaded in order to be ready to use
the application from the first step.
